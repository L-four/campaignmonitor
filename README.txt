Campaign Monitor\
=========\
\
----------------\
Description\
----------------\
\
This module integrates the mailing list service Campaign Monitor. \
http://www.campaignmonitor.com\
\
Campaign Monitor is a mailing list and newsletter service useful for web and design professionals to manage newsletters and campaigns for your clients. The client can then login through a reports interface to view the detailed reports of their campaign.\
\
TO USE THIS MODULE YOU MUST HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH CAMPAIGNMONITOR.COM\
\
This module adds a block that allows people to subscribe to a Campaign Monitor list through the API. It also adds a page that lists past campaigns.\
\
This module was developed by T-Rex Art: http://www.trexart.com.au\
\
------------\
Installation\
------------\
\
- At this time the module uses the built in libraries of PHP5 for he SOAP calls so it is not available for use with PHP4. If you find there are errors, make sure that your PHP installation \
has SOAP enabled.\
\
- Create a folder in your modules directory called campaignmonitor and put the module's files in this directory\
\
- Enable the module on the Modules admin page:\
    Administer > Site building > Modules\
\
------------------\
Configuration\
-----------------\
\
Make sure to have your API Key and Client Id.\
To retrieve these values follow the instructions here:\
http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/required.aspx\
\
This module has been updated to work with the new combined Campaign Monitor and MailBuild service, so please make sure you have updated your API keys if needed.\
\
Enter these into the module's settings page. You will then be able to choose if you wish all lists to be available on the site, or if you want to just select certain lists to display on the site.\
\
It is encouraged for you to spend some time setting up your campaign monitor account before diving in with this module.\
\
NOTE: There is a setting for each list in Campaign Monitor where if you unsubscribe from one list, you are unsubscribed from all lists. The default for this is to unsubscribe from all. This makes it so if in the 'My Newsletters' area, a user unsubscribes from one list, they will be unsubscribed from all. I recommend turning off this feature in the Campaign Monitor admin.\
\
-----------------\
Future plans\
-----------------\
\
 I hope to integrate more of the API into this module in the future. \
